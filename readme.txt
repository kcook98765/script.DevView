DevView

As you interact with kodi, use this tool to view data/information related to the current view.

Access to this report of data can be done in a couple ways:

1) Use a web browser on same machine, or if port is set and available to your network, you can access via web browser:

http://172.0.0.1:9999

(127.0.0.1 is if browser is on same machine, else use the ip of the kodi machine)
(port 9999 is default, but you can set another port in settings)

2) Access the same report directly from within kodi by using the context menu option or map a key to run it (so you can view in areas where no context menu is available)

The disply is a fullscreen dump of the html report.
